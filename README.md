## Problems and Solutions

### 0/1 Knapsack Problem
- **File Name**: `0|1 Knapsack problem`
- **Description**: Solution to the classic 0/1 Knapsack problem where we determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack.

### Coin Change Problem
- **File Name**: `Coin Change`
- **Description**: Implementation of the coin change problem which finds the minimum number of coins required to make a certain amount using the given denominations.

### Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- **File Name**: `LCS`
- **Description**: Algorithm to find the length of the longest common subsequence between two sequences.

### Matrix Chain Multiplication
- **File Name**: `Matrix Chain Multiplication`
- **Description**: Solution to the matrix chain multiplication problem that determines the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices.

### Sub-Set Sum Problem
- **File Name**: `Sub-Set Sum`
- **Description**: Solution to the subset sum problem where we check if there exists a subset of the given set with a sum equal to a given target.



## History
